In order to collect more data for the business plan, additional queries could be run to paint a bigger picture of how the weather might affect the shops.
-	Determine what temperature could be considered cold enough to deter sales and tally the number of days that the temperature was recorded.
-	Find what weather stations recorded the greatest number of “sales-friendly” temperature days and plan our locations in the surrounding areas.
